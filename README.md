# Air Canvas: Hand Tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe

Air Canvas is a project that enables users to draw in the air using hand tracking technology. By leveraging the power of OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries, Air Canvas accurately detects and tracks hand movements in real-time, providing an interactive and intuitive drawing experience.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking: The system tracks the user's hand movements in real-time, allowing them to draw in the air without any physical contact.
- Virtual canvas: Air Canvas provides a virtual canvas where users can draw using their hand gestures.
- Multiple drawing tools: Users can choose from various drawing tools, such as pens, brushes, or erasers, to create their artwork.
- User-friendly interface: The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for controlling the drawing process and interacting with the canvas.
